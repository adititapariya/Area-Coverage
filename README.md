# Area Coverage Algorithm
The Area Coverage Algorithm efficiently covers the maximum area using GPS coordinates. It maps the designated area into a 2D plane utilizing advanced mathematical logic and formulas. This algorithm ensures that SWEEP optimally cleans large areas of the beach, maximizing its cleaning efficiency.

# Goal-to-Goal Algorithm
The Goal-to-Goal Algorithm facilitates the traversal of SWEEP from one location to another. It incorporates orientation and goal-to-goal movement, enabling the robot to navigate across the beach with precision. This algorithm ensures that SWEEP reaches its designated cleaning areas effectively and reliably.

# Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm
The Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm ensures that SWEEP can avoid obstacles encountered during its cleaning operations. By utilizing SONAR sensors, the algorithm detects obstacles in the robot's path and dynamically adjusts its trajectory to navigate around them safely. This capability enables SWEEP to operate autonomously in complex beach environments without compromising its cleaning performance.
